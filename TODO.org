possibilities:
- +separate extension that allows one-click bookmarking?+
- +add contextmenu entry for two-click bookmarking+
- javascript bookmarklet to add bookmark
* TODO improve "add-bookmark" js bookmarklet
** TODO fix CORS problem that occurs on some sites (if possible)
Current understanding of the problem:
- js bookmarklets run in the context of the current page's js execution
  environment (and not on a separate thread in its own environment).
- this means we have to respect the site's Content Security Policies (CSP)
- some sites block any external script or fetch call from running
- confirmed: GitHub

** TODO auto-generate bookmarklet
- on index.html (no access auth data?)
- OR inside options.html
* TODO dont allow duplicate bookmarks
** TODO indicate if current page is already bookmarked
- might require more permissions and a background worker
- indicate by changing the icon of the extension
* TODO search option
* TODO import existing bookmarks
- directly from browser using an api/permission if that is possible
- via a bookmarks.html / bookmarks.json file
* TODO dark/light mode
** TODO dark/light mode switch on dashboard (default to system default)
** TODO use system default on extension popup, switch in options.html
* TODO customizable settings for every bookmark
* TODO improve category UI/UX
** TODO add divider between categories
** TODO collapsible categories
* TODO support sidebar/sidepanel view (using sidebar API)
- is this compatible with both firefox & chrome?
- maybe allow setting preference in options.html
- maybe make it default (remove popup?) 
* TODO simple docker container
- bookmarks db inside data/ folder
* TODO syncthing-able bookmarks.json/bookmarks.html
- needs file watcher to check for changes
- maybe switch to NETSCAPE-Bookmark-file-1 (html)
* TODO start using tailwind compiler
* DONE test running on vps behind reverse proxy w/ basic auth
CLOSED: [2026-01-04 Sun 00:35]
solution:
- allow OPTIONS requests at PathPrefix(`/api`) to pass-through without
  basic-auth
- needed so browser can send its preflight requests (no way to set it to use
  basic-auth possible it seems)
- service set to run at docker bridge ip via .env
* TODO feat: pastebin
** TODO add button to send clipboard to bookmarkd
** TODO add button to copy into clipboard from bookmarkd
